# PyTorch Model Training UI
This is a model training dashboard created with NextJS in React.
It is an easy to use sleek interface that can start and monitor training sessions for multiple models.
It also includes custom training codes created by [@Glas42](https://github.com/Glas42), and edited by me to work with this software. (You can find most of these codes [here](https://github.com/Glas42/PyTorch-ML)
Multiple different PyTorch model types are supported, including:

- Image Classification (Single and Multi-Label)
- Language Classification
- Object Detection
- Regression

Please note, this app is currently really broken and msot likely does not work yet.
